# Room Occupancy Prediction 

This webpage consumes an API endpoint running a machine learning model capable of predicting the number of persons (**limited for use in a small space where maximum occupancy is just 3 persons at a time**) in a room based on indoor atmospheric parameters.

This website was developed using `React` v "^18.2.0", `Typescript` v "^4.8.3", `TailwindCSS` v "^3.3.1", `Axios` v "^0.27.2", `React-Icons` v "^4.4.0", `Material UI` v "^5.12.0", and `Styled-components` v "^5.3.9" libraries.

Deployed with `Netlify` at this [link](https://occupancy-adeoluwa.netlify.app/).
